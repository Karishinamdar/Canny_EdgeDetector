# Canny_EdgeDetector

The Canny edge detection algorithm is based on grayscale images. Hence, the pre-requisite is to convert the images into grayscale. This algorithm consist of 5 steps:
1.Noise reduction
2.Gradient calculation;
3.Non-maximum suppression;
4.Double threshold;
5.Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
